# Pre-Meeting Preparation: Needs and Requests

## ü§ù Meeting Preparation Checklist

This document uses principles of non-violent communication and relationship research to structure our conversation productively. Each item follows the format: **What happened** ‚Üí **How I felt** ‚Üí **What I need** ‚Üí **My request**.

---

## 1. Meeting Readiness and Emotional Safety

**What happened**: We've had some challenging conversations recently that have felt unproductive or triggering.

**How I felt**: I felt uncertain and anxious about whether we're both in the right emotional space for meaningful dialogue.

**What I need**: I need reassurance that we're both committed to approaching this conversation with patience and good faith.

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Take a moment at the start of our meeting to check in with each other about our emotional readiness and agree to pause if either of us becomes flooded or reactive?

---

## 2. Commitment to Repair and Forgiveness

**What happened**: Sometimes our disagreements have lingered without clear resolution or repair.

**How I felt**: I felt insecure about our foundation and whether we're both committed to working through challenges together.

**What I need**: I need reassurance that forgiveness and repair will be our ongoing commitment, and clarity about what we can expect from each other regarding peace, reactivity, and avoiding "enemy mode."

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Explicitly affirm our commitment to repair and forgiveness, and discuss what specific behaviors we can both count on to maintain emotional safety?

---

## 3. Meeting Structure and Scope

**What happened**: Our conversations sometimes expand beyond what we can handle in one session, leaving us both drained.

**How I felt**: I felt overwhelmed and worried that we might not make progress on the most important issues.

**What I need**: I need us to agree on a clear scope and agenda for this conversation to protect our energy and focus on solvable problems.

**Therefore, would you mind if**: We limit today's discussion to a pre-agreed agenda with specific categories like: Important Family Decisions, Problems to Solve, and Requests/Needs?

---

## 4. External Stressors as Team Challenge

**What happened**: We're both dealing with external pressures that might be affecting our relationship dynamic.

**How I felt**: I felt like we might be taking stress out on each other instead of supporting each other through it.

**What I need**: I need us to face external stresses as a team rather than letting them create distance between us.

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Acknowledge the external stressors we're both facing and commit to supporting each other through them rather than letting them create tension between us?

---

## 5. Time Allocation Discussions

**What happened**: There have been ongoing conversations about how I spend time working or with Sophia.

**How I felt**: I felt criticized and defensive, which makes it hard for me to hear your actual needs.

**What I need**: I need complaints about my time allocation to be contained to our Monday meetings rather than brought up throughout the week.

**Therefore, would you mind if**: We agree that time allocation concerns will be saved for our weekly meetings unless there's an urgent, specific issue that needs immediate attention?

---

## 6. Evening Decision-Making Process

**What happened**: We often spend too much energy deciding what to do together in the evenings.

**How I felt**: I felt pressured and sometimes frustrated by the decision-making process, which took away from our enjoyment.

**What I need**: I need to act more consistently on nights we've agreed to be together, but also need to reduce the pressure around making these decisions while still honoring the input we've already given each other.

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Use a quick decision tool (like a randomizer among agreed options) within 5 minutes each evening, then commit to that choice without further debate?

---

## 7. Sophia's School Situation

**What happened**: When Sophia's school situation came up recently, the conversation focused primarily on how it's affecting you emotionally.

**How I felt**: I felt unheard and concerned that my perspectives weren't being considered as valid.

**What I need**: I need my opinions and beliefs about Sophia's school situation to be heard and considered, even after you've shared how it's affecting you emotionally.

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Create space for both of our perspectives on Sophia's school, where you can express your concerns AND I can share my concerns, opinions, or needs once you feel heard?

---

## 8. Freedom to Express Concerns

**What happened**: This morning when I tried to bring up a topic that concerned me, I was told to stop immediately.

**How I felt**: I felt misunderstood, silenced, and accused of doing something wrong when I was trying to communicate openly.

**What I need**: I need to be able to speak freely about topics that concern me without being shut down before I can fully express myself.

**Therefore, would you mind if**: We reserve "stop" requests for when conversations are truly getting out of hand, exhausting, or someone is flooded, rather than using it immediately in response to bringing up a concern?

## 9. Morning Communication Needs

**How I felt**: [To be filled in during our conversation]

**What I need**: [To be filled in during our conversation]

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: [To be discussed together]

---

## 10. Receiving Feedback and Improvement Requests

**What happened**: When we discuss relationship improvements or you share what you need from me, sometimes the feedback feels overwhelming or unclear.

**How I felt**: I felt uncertain about whether I could meet expectations and worried about disappointing you.

**What I need**: I need to hear specific, recent examples of a single problem or unmet need so I can better understand how to solve it, with patient and reasonable expectations for change.

**Therefore, would you mind if**: When sharing feedback, you focus on one specific, recent example at a time, and we discuss realistic timelines and expectations for change?

---

## 11. Creating Space for Tricia's Needs

**What happened**: I want to make sure I'm creating adequate space to hear and respond to your needs.

**How I felt**: I want to feel confident that I'm being a good listener and partner.

**What I need**: I need clarity about how I can best listen for and respond to your needs during our conversations.

**Therefore, would you be willing to**: Share with me what helps you feel most heard and understood, and let me know if there are specific ways you'd like me to ask about or respond to your needs?

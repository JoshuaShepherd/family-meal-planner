Meeting
I need to check in about whether we both feel ready to have this conversation in a productive way.

I need reassurance that forgiveness/repair will be the ongoing commitment in our family, and to clarify what each of us can expect from each other in terms of overall peace; enemy mode; reactivity etc.

I need us to agree on a scope for this conversation and stick to it, for the sake of our energy levels, our ability to solve solvabe problems, and because of a potentially heightened sense of triggers due to external stressors.

I propose that we consider what we would like this week to look like.

I propose that we decide a clear agenda for this meeting, such as:
   Important Family Decisions
   Problems to Solve
   Requests/Needs

I need us to face those external stresses together. 

I need the things we are going to discuss today to be chosen carefully, and then for us to discuss only those things. Some ideas for categories:
Good, positive things from recent weeks.
Needs This Week
Issues to Address 1 at a Time
Commitments for Peace/Forgiveness/Repair etc.

I need to know that -- apart from Monday meetings -- complaints about how I spend time either working or with Sophia or whatever will be contained. 

I need to act more consistently when it comes to the nights we have agreed to be together. I also need, for my own benefit, to lower the pressure to make decisions about what we do each night. But I also need for the input we've already givent to be honored. Therefore, I propose that:
Each night we use one of the decision tools within 5 minutes and leave it at that. Could be randomizer among the options, etc.

Potential Things to Talk About
Sophia's school.
I need for my opinions and beliefs about Sophia's school situation to be heard and considered, even if you recently shared the way it's affecting you emotionally. That means, you can be heard about your concerns AND when you feel heard, I can share if I have my own concerns or opinions or desires or needs.

What I needed when I spoke up this morning.
I need to be able to speak freely about topics that concern me, without being told to stop IMMEDIATELY.

"Stop" should be about stopping something when it's getting out of hand or has become exhausting, or there is floodedness. When you tell me to stop immediately in response to one thing I've said, I feel misunderstood and accused. 

What I need in the mornings.

When we are discussing ways to improve our relationship or you are telling me what you need or things I can do better, I need to be able to hear specific, recent examples of a single problem or unmet need so I can better understand how to solve it - and know that change expectations will be handled in a patient and reasonable way. This means that hearing about general problems that aren't tied to specific, recent events or a collection of problems from the past will likely be overwhelming and I'll feel uncertain about whether I can meet unclear or reactive expectations.

How can I listen for Tricia's needs.

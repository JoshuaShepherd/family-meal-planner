First, always convert these instructions into a checklist at the beginning of each step and always leave this step here.

Second, turn the grocery_list.md into a full markdown readme file for printing and documentation.

Third, turn needs_list_josh.md -- this is going to require more thought -- into a pre-meeting document that incorporates the concepts of non-violent communication and like Gottman-style X happened. I felt Y. I need Z. But then add a reasonable request to each one that is like:

Separate each individual need/request for clarity of understanding.
